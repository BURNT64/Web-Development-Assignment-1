    <h2> <img src="Img\Will Allwood Second Photo.jpeg" class = "img">Biography/Background</h2>
    <p> Will Allwood grew up in the UK within the county of shropshire as a kid with nystagmus (a visual impairment) and autsim (a behavioural disorder) which effected him growing up and will continue to affect him throughout life. Despite the disadvantages he faced compared to others around him,Will was still able to do extremely well academically and form many great friendships even with his disabilities, this was a result of having a fantastic support network around him not to mention his own burning desire to prove to everyone that he could become succesful in life.</p>
    <p> During primary and secondary school Will was subjected to bullying despite everything he has achieved. Despite this, Will doesn't look back on those memories negatively in fact it is a reminder of how far he has come in life, without those negative experiences WIll wouldn't be the man he is today. Will would go on to achieve top marks in college which not only gave him 3 A levels but also allowed him to enrol at the University of Chester. This is only a brief biography of WIlls life, if you want to hear more of the story tune in to the Disabled Success podcast which will be hosted every Wednesday of the week. </p>
