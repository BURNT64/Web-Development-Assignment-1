    <h2> <img src="Img\Instagram.png" class = "img-two">Instagram</h2>
    <p>I started my instagram page in 2021 around August but then commited to the idea of posting in september just before University, this is because i knew i would meet many new people through the university so it was a great way to give me a stromg starting follower count, I mainly use instagram to showcase my life and important events that happen, this might include my fitness journey, current events, or anything related to me.</p>
    <p>My succes on instagram is what gave me the confidence to branch out onto other platforms of social media which would ultimatley allow me to grow my online presence and establish quality connections, Through my instagram you can see my other social media that I have linked in my personal description. this allows people who find my account to look at what i do online which will hopefully prove to be succesful as time goes on.</p>

    <h2> <img src="Img\Podcast.png" class = "img-two">Podcast</h2>
    <p>"This podcast is hosted by Will Allwood who is affected by Autism and Nystagmus, on this podcast, WIll is going to give advice on how he has succeeded in life even with being visually impaired and autistic, the show may even dip into other disabilities with the appearance of guests and their success stories. You can learn a lot from this podcast but hopefully, you can also laugh along with WIll as he gives his views and perspective on life as a disabled yet successful person."</p>
    <p>The paragraph above is the actual description used for the podcast on spotifiy, I hope to grow this show to a point where it can sustain a passive income while also spreading a posative message about achieving success even when handicapped by something out of your control. The podcast will at least have 30 episodes each year and every year i plan to up the production quality in order to ensure the audience gets the best experience possible.</p>

  <div class="article">
    <h2> <img src="Img\Twitter.png" class = "img-two">Twitter</h2>
    <p>My Twitter page is similar to my instagram page however it is much more focused on updates about myself, lets say if there is a big event or i have something to say on a certain topic i will use twitter to voice my opinion, however the growth of my twitter has been much slower than my other endevours so it isn't the main focus right now, if it starts to grow the goal will be to achieve the verified status but only time will tell if that will actually happen.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="article">
    <h2> <img src="Img\Youtube.png" class = "img-two">Youtube</h2>
    <p>"I'll be posting mainly gaming content one a weekly basis, this might include lets plays challenge runs, reviews etc. I might branch out to vlogging and even a podcast (should the channel grow), Be sure to subscribe it's gonna be fun." I will begin uploading to youtube once i feel confident in doing so, this is because it will be to taxing on my time as I am a university student who has to manage a podcast, instagram, studies and more, but rest assured it will be used one day. </p>
